# Stock-Valuation
Stock Valuation and Analysis Tool

Description

This project provides a comprehensive Python tool for financial analysis and stock valuation, integrating data fetching, processing, and modeling to assess the value of publicly traded companies. Utilizing historical stock data from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library, the tool calculates key financial metrics, estimates the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), performs Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation, and predicts future stock prices using an LSTM neural network model.

Features

Data Fetching: Retrieves historical stock data and financial metrics directly from Yahoo Finance.
Financial Metrics Calculation: Computes fundamental financial metrics such as Free Cash Flow (FCF) and its growth rate, and aggregates dividend payouts over the past five years.
WACC Calculation: Estimates the Weighted Average Cost of Capital based on market data inputs.
DCF Valuation: Performs a DCF analysis to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock based on projected future cash flows.
LSTM Price Prediction: Implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices based on historical price data.
Data Visualization: Plots historical stock prices to provide visual insights into stock performance over time.
Comprehensive Reporting: Generates a detailed report summarizing financial metrics, DCF valuation, and LSTM model performance.

Installation
To set up this project, you need Python 3.x installed, along with several packages that are listed in requirements.txt. Install these dependencies via pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the stock valuation and analysis tool, execute the main.py script from the command line:

python main.py
Ensure you configure the script with the desired stock symbol and relevant financial parameters before running.

Configuration
Modify the following variables in the main.py script to fit the stock you are analyzing:

symbol: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.)
start_date: Start date of the historical data fetch (format: 'YYYY-MM-DD')
end_date: End date of the historical data fetch (format: 'YYYY-MM-DD')
